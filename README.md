Reactive rx-java code snippets

There are three launchers representing the examples in our article. Just do a maven install of the project and launch the main of each:
1. WordLauncher - The "quick brown fox" example
2. MetronomeLauncher - Merging the two streams to produce a clock that varies every 15 seconds
3. EmitterLauncher - Emits stock feeds. These are randomly generated, don't go out and buy or sell based on this!!

The other examples in the various testers are random reactive examples
