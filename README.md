Reactive rx-java code snippets
There are three launchers representing the examples in our article. Just do a maven install of the project and launch the main of each:
WordLauncher - The "quick brown fox" example
MetronomeLauncher - Merging the two streams to produce a clock that varies every 15 seconds
EmitterLauncher - Emits stock feeds. These are randomly generated, don't go out and buy or sell based on this!!
